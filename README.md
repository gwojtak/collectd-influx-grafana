# collectd-influx-grafana

A set of configurations for a collectd, influx, and grafana.  The
configurations were originally used on an Ubuntu system, however
they should still be valid on other systems though pathing may change.

## Dependencies

The following software packages and versions were used:

 - collected 5.5.1
 - influxdb 1.2.4
 - grafana 4.6.1

It should be safe to use the most recent versions of collectd and grafana.
InfluxDB was a little more picky about the version.
